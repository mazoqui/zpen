    - Enhanced navigation: Use arrow keys (`←`/`→`) or spacebar to cycle colors.
- **Step Counter:**
    
    - Display a step counter for drawings made with the freehand tool.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux with X Window System (X11)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `libx11-dev` - X11 development libraries
  - `xclip` - Clipboard management (usually pre-installed)
  - `gcc` - C compiler
  - `make` (optional, for build automation)

### Install Dependencies

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install libx11-dev xclip build-essential
```

**Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install libX11-devel xclip gcc
# or for older versions:
sudo yum install libX11-devel xclip gcc
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S libx11 xclip gcc
```

## Installation

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd zpen
   ```

2. **Compile:**
   ```bash
   cd src
   gcc zpen.c -o zpen -lX11 -lm
   ```

3. **Run:**
   ```bash
   ./zpen
   ```

### Global Installation (Optional)

To install zPen system-wide:

```bash
# Compile
cd src
gcc zpen.c -o zpen -lX11 -lm

# Install to /usr/local/bin
sudo cp zpen /usr/local/bin/

# Now you can run zPen from anywhere
zpen
```

## Desktop Integration

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can set up global keyboard shortcuts to launch zPen quickly:

**XFCE:**
```bash
xfconf-query -c xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts -n -t 'string' -p '/commands/custom/<Super>p' -s /usr/local/bin/zpen
```

**Cinnamon (Linux Mint):**
```bash
dconf write /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/custom-list "['custom0']"
dconf write /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/custom-keybindings/custom0/command "'/usr/local/bin/zpen'"
dconf write /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/custom-keybindings/custom0/name "'zPen Drawing Tool'"
dconf write /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/custom-keybindings/custom0/binding "['<Super>p']"
```

**GNOME:**
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings "['/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/']"
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ name 'zPen Drawing Tool'
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ command '/usr/local/bin/zpen'
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ binding '<Super>p'
```

### Direction Detection
- **Curly Braces (`k`)**: Drag left-to-right for `{`, drag right-to-left for `}`
- **Square Brackets (`b`)**: Drag left-to-right for `[`, drag right-to-left for `]`

### Mouse Controls

- **Left Click:** Set the starting point of the tool or add a point in freehand mode.
- **Drag:** Draw the shape.
- **Release:** Finish drawing the shape.

## File Management

### Screenshot Saving

Screenshots are automatically saved in the `~/.zpen` directory with timestamp-based filenames in the format `imgYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.png`. The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

**Example files:**
- `~/.zpen/img20241201143052.png` - Screenshot taken on Dec 1, 2024 at 14:30:52

### File Formats

- **Screenshots**: PNG format for best quality and transparency support
- **Clipboard**: Images are copied in PNG format for clipboard compatibility

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Single-file C application** using Xlib for X11 integration
- **Fullscreen transparent overlay** that doesn't interfere with desktop interaction
- **Memory-efficient** with minimal system resource usage
- **Real-time drawing** with XOR graphics for smooth preview

### Performance Features
- **Path smoothing** for freehand drawing with configurable smoothing levels
- **Efficient undo system** using pixmap snapshots (up to 20 levels)
- **Minimal latency** for responsive drawing experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot open display" error:**
- Ensure you're running on a system with X11 (not Wayland-only)
- Check if `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set: `echo $DISPLAY`

**Missing libraries error:**
- Install X11 development packages: `sudo apt install libx11-dev`

**Permission issues with screenshots:**
- Ensure `~/.zpen` directory has write permissions
- Check that `xclip` is installed for clipboard functionality

### Wayland Compatibility

zPen currently requires X11 and may not work on pure Wayland systems. For Wayland users:
- Use XWayland compatibility layer
- Consider running in X11 session for full functionality
